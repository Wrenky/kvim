# kvim

My neovim configuration using [nixvim](https://github.com/nix-community/nixvim). Its very much under progress, as I'm still learning nix and nixvim- I've taken inspriation from many incredible nixvim implimentations out there to help create my implimentation.

While I've read hundreds of personal implimenations, these were my favorites:

* https://github.com/gwg313/nvim-nix
* https://github.com/hbjydev/hvim
* https://github.com/elythh/nixvim/tree/main
* https://github.com/JMartJonesy/kickstart.nixvim/tree/standalone

I use this configuration in my home-manager setup.
